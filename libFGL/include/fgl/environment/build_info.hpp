@brief Build environment detection

@details
	This header provides a way to detect the build environment. In most cases,
	it provides language level aliases for the build environment preprocessor
	symbols
@warning
	Include order and location matters. For example: variables which depend on
	macros such as <tt>NDEBUG</tt> are only a valid reflection of the program
	state at the point of inclusion because the symbols may be defined,
	un-defined, or re-defined at any point before or after inclusion of this
	header which may make the boolean state invalid (not an accurate reflection
	of the the macro). For this reason, usage of <tt>#ifdef</tt> and
	<tt>#ifndef</tt> is recommended in translation units which may
	<tt>#define</tt> and <tt>#undef<tt> preprocessor symbols frequently, or
	with unpredictable header ordering.
